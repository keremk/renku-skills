## Producer Selection Decision Tree

### Video Generation

Choose your producer based on your source material and consistency requirements:

```
Do you have reference images for subjects that must look consistent?
├── YES → Do subjects need to appear recognizable across multiple clips?
│         ├── YES → ref-image-to-video.yaml
│         │         Use cases:
│         │         • Consistent character appearance throughout video
│         │         • Product placement with specific product images
│         │         • Room/scene with recognizable furniture or objects
│         │         • Multiple characters that look the same across scenes
│         └── NO  → Do you REQUIRE guaranteed start/end frame interpolation?
│                   ├── YES → start-end-frame-to-video.yaml
│                   ├── NO  → image-to-video.yaml (EndImage optional)
│                   └── Need Kling multi-shot/elements? → kling-multishot.yaml
│
├── NO  → Do you have a start image (and optionally end image)?
│         ├── YES → image-to-video.yaml
│         │         Use cases:
│         │         • Continuous video from image sequence
│         │         • Staggered clips: end of clip N = start of clip N+1
│         │         • Animating a still image
│         └── NO  → text-to-video.yaml
│                   Use cases:
│                   • Full creative freedom for the model
│                   • Single scene from text description
│                   • No visual constraints needed
│
├── Do you have existing video to modify?
│   ├── Transform/edit/extend → video-to-video.yaml
│   ├── Apply lip-sync → video-lipsync.yaml
│   ├── Transfer motion to character → motion-transfer.yaml
│   └── Upscale resolution → video-upscale.yaml
│
└── Do you have reference videos for consistency?
    └── ref-video-to-video.yaml
```

### Talking Head Video

```
Do you already have audio for the voice?
├── YES → talking-head.yaml
│         Use cases:
│         • Lip-sync existing voiceover to avatar
│         • Pre-recorded narration
│         • Voice cloned audio
│
└── NO  → text-to-talking-head.yaml
          Use cases:
          • Generate speech and video together
          • Text-to-speech integrated with avatar
```

## Key Decision Rules

### image-to-video vs start-end-frame-to-video

**Use `image-to-video.yaml` when:**
- You have a start image and *optionally* an end image
- Creating continuous video from an image sequence
- Staggering clips: end image of clip N = start image of clip N+1
- EndImage support varies by model

**Use `start-end-frame-to-video.yaml` when:**
- You REQUIRE guaranteed interpolation between two specific frames
- Both start and end images are available and must be used
- Every listed model supports both frames

### image-to-video vs ref-image-to-video

**Use `image-to-video.yaml` when:**
- Your image IS the first frame of the video
- Starting frame must match a specific visual
- Creating video continuation from a previous frame

**Use `ref-image-to-video.yaml` when:**
- Maintaining consistent character appearance across multiple clips
- Product placement with specific product images
- Reference images guide subject appearance, NOT the camera/composition

### text-to-video vs image-to-video

**Use `text-to-video.yaml` when:**
- No reference images are needed
- Full creative freedom for the model
- Single scene generation from description

**Use `image-to-video.yaml` when:**
- Starting frame must match a specific visual
- Creating video continuation from a previous frame
- Ensuring visual consistency in multi-clip sequences

### talking-head vs text-to-talking-head vs video-lipsync

**Use `talking-head.yaml` when:**
- You already have audio (pre-recorded or generated separately)
- Using voice cloning with specific audio samples
- Separating TTS from video generation for more control

**Use `text-to-talking-head.yaml` when:**
- Generating speech and video in one step
- Simpler workflow with fewer producers
- Voice selection by ID rather than audio sample

**Use `video-lipsync.yaml` when:**
- You already have a video and want to change the speech
- Re-dubbing existing video content
- The video exists but needs new lip movements

### kling-multishot vs generic producers

**Use `kling-multishot.yaml` when:**
- You need per-shot prompts (multi_prompt)
- Using Kling elements system for character references
- Need voice_ids for speech in video
- Working with Kling O1/O3 models (only available here)

**Use generic producers (text-to-video, image-to-video) when:**
- Simple single-prompt generation is sufficient
- Kling V3 models in single-prompt mode
- Don't need Kling-specific advanced features
